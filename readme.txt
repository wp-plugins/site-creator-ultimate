= Introduction =

This plugin works by using layouts. A layout is basically a list of posts that can have a specific look. The layout (or the posts) can then be displayed on a page, post or widget. To display it a short code is used. For example to display layout 1 the following short code can be used:

[sitecreator show="1"]

Up to 20 layouts that can be used but sometimes you only need one. The layout in its default state will show 3 posts with a simple layout with no filters or effects which is a starting point. To this more elements, filters and effects can be added.
To display several layouts in one page, simply add several short codes after each other For example:

[sitecreator show="1"] [sitecreator show="2"] [sitecreator show="3"]




= Example: How do I create a new front page? =

By adding one or several layouts on a page we can create a great news, magazine or business looking front page. To display the layouts we have to use a shortcode for each of the layouts. You also need to change the look of each layout you use by changing options such as image size, number of posts to show, etc. In this example we will use 1 layout.

1. Edit the layout 1 to your liking (assuming you are not using it already). Here you can change the look of your blog by changing image size, number of posts to show, add pagination, etc.
2. Create a new page. Click on "add a new page" which will be your new front page
3. Display the layout you created in step 1 by adding a short code. If we are using layout 1 the short code will be [sitecreator show="1"]
4. To make the page you created a front page go to Settings -> Reading Settings and, mark the static page. In the drop down list, choose the page you just created


= Example: How do I create a new front page for my blog? =

1. Edit the layout 1 to your liking (assuming you are not using it already). Here you can change the look of your blog by changing image size, number of posts to show, add pagination, etc.
2. Create a new page. Click on "add a new page" which will be your new front page
3. Display the layout you created in step 1 by adding a short code. If we are using layout 1 the short code will be [sitecreator show="1"]
4. To make the page you created a front page go to Settings -> Reading Settings and, mark the static page. In the drop down list, choose the page you just created


= Example: How do I create a widget? =

The plugin also allows you to create different type of widgets. Example of widgets:

* display the latest posts
* random posts
* post from a certain category
* posts from a certain author
* most commented/popular posts. 

The widget can be customized with nice, visual image effects. In this example we will create a widget to show the latest posts from a certain category.

1. Choose layout 1 or a layout you have not used yet
2. Change the layout to your liking by adding title, excerpt and changing image size etc. Important: Make sure that the image and the post is small enough to fit into your sidebar!
3. Under "Show posts only from category" select the category you want show posts from
4. save
5. We have now created a layout. To create a widget with this layout we need to do the following: Under Appearance -> widget drag a text widget (that allows you to add arbitrary text or HTML) to your desired sidebar.
6. Add a title to the widget and copy the short code [sitecreator show="1"] (if using layout 1) into the bigger text field and save. The widget should now show up.

There are 3 areas (left, right, top) plus over image area and pop up area where elements like title and excerpt can be displayed. There is also position 1 to 10 where 1 is top and 10 is bottom. This allows elements to positioned relative each other in the same area. Example: To put the title in the top of the left area select left and 1.


= Image options =

note: the plugin only works with images uploaded trough WordPress own system.

The plugin uses the image sizes set under settings->media. You can set the width and height of the image in the layout settings, this will just upscale or down scale the image without actually changing the original image size. If a featured image is set for the post then that will be used, otherwise if a image have been inserted into the post then that image will be used

important: Using full html can make the layout look unformatted and bad because the html code can interfere with the plugin.

= CSS Styling =

To be able to change title size, edit background colors and other graphics in CSS, you need to add a CSS file. IMPORTANT - To protect your CSS file from being overwritten you need to put it in a safe directory outside the plugin directory. Change the CSS file URL in the main option page to point to your CSS file. Steps:

1. take a copy of the style.css in the plugins directory
2. put the copy in a safe directory outside the plugin. Example the root or the themes folder
3. Change the CSS file URL in the main option page to point to your CSS file.Note: adding a CSS file will not disable the CSS file in the plugin, both will be used.

= Main options page =

CSS file URL - you only need to fill this in if you want to use your own CSS file, see CSS section for more info.

Layout example width - Let you specify the width of the example under each layout in the admin section. You can if you want set it to similar to your theme width.

Allow duplicate - will not repeat the same post more than one time on a page if you are specifying it here.
